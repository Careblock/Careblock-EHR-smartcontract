## Workflow Overview
![Smart contract](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03c32df2-6d7c-46e7-ab02-926fbcc0a4f0)

### Step 1: Request Appointment
- The patient (User) sends an appointment request through the system.
- The request is forwarded to the system to create an appointment.

### Step 2: Accept Appointment
- The Doctor receives the request and accepts the appointment.
- Upon acceptance, the appointment is created in the system.

### Step 3: Create a Treatment Record
- After the appointment is accepted, a treatment record for the patient is created.
- This record includes detailed information about treatment, diagnosis, and related procedures.

### Step 4: Upload to IPFS
- The patient's treatment information is uploaded to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for distributed data storage and integrity assurance.

### Step 5: Upload to Cardano Node
- The treatment information is also uploaded to the Cardano blockchain node to ensure data security, transparency, and immutability.

### Step 6: View Treatment Information
- Patients (Users) can view their treatment information after it is uploaded to the storage systems.
- This information can be retrieved from IPFS and Cardano, ensuring that the patient has access to their treatment data at any time.

## Workflow Summary
1. **Request**: The patient requests an appointment.
2. **Accept**: The healthcare provider accepts the appointment.
3. **Create**: The system creates a treatment record for the patient.
4. **Upload to IPFS**: Treatment information is uploaded to IPFS.
5. **Upload to Cardano Node**: Treatment information is uploaded to the Cardano node.
6. **View**: The patient can view their treatment information.

## Benefits of the Workflow
- **Security**: Using Cardano's blockchain ensures that patient treatment data is secure and immutable.
- **Distributed Storage**: Using IPFS for distributed data storage reduces the risk of data loss.
- **Easy Access**: Patients can access and view their treatment information at any time, ensuring their rights and transparency.
